statistics to calculate:
	2010 paper:
		global sedentary time
		distribution of the length of sedentary bouts
			power distribution (C, alpha)
			standard error
			median of power law distribution
		measure of pattern of sedentary time accumulation
			time in sedentary bouts above median

	2015 paper:
		appears to be the 2010 paper

currently done:
	model works well and produces tennable output for most .csv files
	can take multiple .csv at once
	manually going through the dataframe, the sleep output is correct
	can run on a variable number of days

final todo:
	patch whatever error is causing it to glitch on one file out of the 20 I have--then test run on the entire database if possible
	remove hard coding of constants in SLNW alg and replace with variables at the start
	calculate whatever summary statistics are needed
	output an activPAL heat map
	output to .csv instead of dataframe
