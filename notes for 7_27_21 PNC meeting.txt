statistics to calculate:
	2010 paper:
		global sedentary time
		distribution of the length of sedentary bouts
			power distribution (C, alpha)
			standard error
			median of power law distribution
			GRAPH: sedentary bout lengths by seconds and Lorentz curve of how the sedentary bouts skew
				Gini coefficient can be used instead of graphing as it captures the essential info of the graph
		measure of pattern of sedentary time accumulation
			time in sedentary bouts above median
	2015 paper:
		appears to be the 2010 paper

currently done:
	model works well and produces tennable output for most .csv files
	can take multiple .csv at once
	manually going through the dataframe, the sleep output is correct
	can run on a variable number of days

final todo:
	patch whatever error is causing it to glitch on one file out of the 20 I have--then test run on the entire database if possible
	remove hard coding of constants in SLNW alg and replace with variables at the start
	calculate whatever summary statistics are needed
	output an activPAL heat map
	output to .csv instead of dataframe

TOTAL STATISTICS:
	sedentary behavior profiling
		start, finish, duration
		average num of bouts per day
		average duration, min, max, median, interquartile range, standard deviation, coefficient of variation
		less than 20 min duration, 20 min or more, all bouts
		30, 60, 90 replacements for 20
		less than 5, 5-9:59, 10 and less than 20
		inclusive and exclusive bounds
	moderate to vigorous physical activity
		10 or more and less than 10
	breaks in sedentary behavior
		frequency per day
		mean median standard dev coefficient
		bucket for stepping, standing
		light vs moderate
			sum stat of step count and activity score and time
	get exact stats

implement summary statistic creator
	input as list of lists ex: list(list(activity 1, lower bound 1, upper bound 1), list(activity 2, lower bound 2, upper bound 2))
	for each list in lists, compute relevant statistics and output to user specified folder
